"""ðŸ§  What is a Linked List?
A linked list is a linear data structure where elements are stored in nodes , and each node points to the next node in the sequence.

Think of it like:

A treasure hunt where each clue leads you to the next location. 

Each node has two parts:

Data : The value it stores
Pointer/Reference : To the next node"""

"""The Fast and Slow Pointer technique (also known as the Tortoise and Hare algorithm ) is a powerful method used in linked lists and sometimes arrays , especially when you want to:

Detect cycles
Find the middle of a list
Find duplicates
Remove the Nth node from the end
This technique uses two pointers:

Slow pointer : moves 1 step at a time
Fast pointer : moves 2 steps at a time
They start at the same point, but eventually:

If there's a cycle , they will meet
If the list is acyclic , fast pointer will reach the end"""
